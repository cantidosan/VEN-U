## General info
<p>This project, while based on an already established sharing platform model such as AirBnB's short term home rental. It takes the concept one step further 
  and comodifies any usable space that the HOST in question owns. The use cases that immediatley come to mind would be the renting of a parking lot for a multi
  hour event </p>
